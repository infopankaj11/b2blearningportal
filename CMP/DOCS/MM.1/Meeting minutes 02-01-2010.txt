Dear All,

As discussed in last meeting (with Ravi, Guru and Thomas), a meeting is scheduled tomorrow as follows:

Date: 02-01-2010
Time: 8:00am (Ravi and Thomas are able to make it, Guru will join afternoon.)
Venue: ISS
Agenda: go through documents required for Audit
Target: to finish required documents as much as possible. (so that we don't need to rush in the following week)

BTW, I will be doing project at ISS today, so anyone gets anything to discuss, just give me a call.

Regards,
Haiyang
