Hi All,
 
Sakthi's India trip was postponed. Yesterday night Guru and I met him and showed the development so far (CMS portion). It was a last minute call. So couldnt inform anyone.
 
Sakthi commented to change the flow of the content creation. I did impact analysis yesterday night and it is huge. The impact is we no more use the prototype which i created. We need to develop fresh things for which we need to add 2 more tables to maintain the treeview of the content chapter, lesson.
 
As we are using opensource we cannot modify the tables which will have even more impact as i already listed down and send you the no of screens & stored procedures used in JMDCMS.
 
I am not saying it is impossible or tough but we have our constraint like
1. opensource
2. parttime development
3. exams
4. deadline
 
But Sakthi's approach will be easy to maintain the system and follow a flow. To develop this it will take additional 10 days (5 man days).
 
Additionaly I will be going to India from Dec 20-27.
 
Please raise your concern if any.
Thanks.
 
with Regards,
Ravikumar.T.
